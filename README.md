# BookListing
This is the seventh project I've submitted to Udacity for the Android Basics NanoDegree. The main criteria of the Project is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. Here I've used the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.
